# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise gather important research on how successful various theater campaigns were in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals in order to decide when to start her first fundraising campaign, *Fever*, and how much she should set her fundraising goal to. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis examined the relationship between the percentage of outcomes: successful, failed, or canceled, compared to the campaigns' launch dates, which were sorted by the month of the launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
One of the analyses performed examines the relationship between the percentage of outcomes: successful, failed, and canceled, compared to the goals, which ranged between less than $1000 to greater than $50,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges that I encountered was not being able to figure how to group the outcomes for the line chart together by months instead of year. Eventually, I figured out how to use the group button on Excel. Another challenge that I had was when doing analyzing the Outcomes Based on Goals line chart, I was getting the same figures for every row, and it turned out that I did not use the COUNTIFS function to filter out the subcategory or the range I was supposed to analyze, but instead I filtered the Kickstarter sheet, which did not work.
## Results
-According to the graph, we can see that May is the most successful month to launch a fundraiser. Also, June, July, and August have roughly the same amount of failed campaigns. Lastly. there weren't many canceled fundraiser campaigns overall. 

-Looking the Outcomes based on Goals, we can observe that roughly 100% of launched campaigns with a goal between $45,000 and $49,999 failed. Additionally, for the same goal range, the percentage of successful campaigns were 0. On the other hand, those that were less than $1000 were the most successful campaigns, reaching around 80%. It fits to mention that the percentage successful and the percentage failed have an inverse relationship. 

-Is the data generalizable? If we are analyzing a sample people, it could not be generalizable to the population and could very well be biased. Also, we do not know if this dataset comes from a credible source, which may also influence the study's credibility and increase bias. 

-We could have a table or graph that studies which fundraiser categories were the least successful and how much the fundraiser goals were in different countries, such as in the US, MX, and etc.
